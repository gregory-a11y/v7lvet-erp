# Project Memory — V7LVET ERP

## Current State
- Phase: scaffolded, ready for PRD
- Last action: project setup complete
- Next action: run /prd for product specification

## Architecture Decisions
- Better Auth 1.4.9 pinned (Convex compatibility)
- ConvexBetterAuthProvider used (not separate providers)
- Auth runs on Convex via @convex-dev/better-auth adapter
- No dark mode (light only, corporate tone)
- Sidebar uses Océan Profond (#063238) dark background
